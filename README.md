# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

To install dependency packages

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Task description

Assignment and Instructions:
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every
dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for
each customer per month and total.

###Checklist

* Goal of the assignment: showcase great craftsmanship in area of REACT JS. Solution should be designed in a way that shows healthy architecture (solutions with 2-3 files will not be accepted). Solution should show the data flow and good practices in working with backend from the UI perspective

* Time required: anywhere between 3-6h depending on proficiency

* Technical guidelines:
    * Can use https://create-react-app.dev/ to get started quickly
    * avoid additional frameworks and Typescript – only REACT JS
    * Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution (can use tools to generate data or manually create some data)
    * Check solution into GitHub and share the URL(Make it Public)
    * Plan your code composition structure (e.g separate service to simulate API request,
separate file to calculate points, split UI into few readable files, etc.)
    * No hardcoded / magic numbers. Use constant definitions/dynamic props
    * Code should be clean, nicely formatted, easy to read and understand and follow best practices
    * UI needs to be reasonably OK. Not expecting a fancy UI.
    * No errors or warnings in runtime
    * Code must compile and run, there should be an instruction in README.md file how to run the application.
    * Nice to have: unit tests
    * Nice to have: error handling after loading application
    * Nice to have: handling of data loading – e.g. spinner
